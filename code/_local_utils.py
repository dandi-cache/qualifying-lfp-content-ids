"""This repository's own helpers for SpikeInterface: opening a file's recordings, and the simple checks of one.

`update.py` keeps the rules that carry the reasoning and the order they are applied in, which is
what decides a file; this module has the means. It opens each ElectricalSeries as a recording,
and answers the plain conditions asked of a recording, so `update.py` reads without the
SpikeInterface plumbing.

It is local on purpose, and named so: it stays in this repository, with the `spikeinterface` pin in
`envs/pyproject.toml`, and is not for `dandi_cache_utils`, the shared upstream library, whose base
image does not carry SpikeInterface. See `AGENTS.md`.
