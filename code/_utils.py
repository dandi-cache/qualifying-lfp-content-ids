"""Reading an NWB file's ElectricalSeries through SpikeInterface.

This is the one place that knows how SpikeInterface streams a remote file. `update.py` asks its
question of the recordings yielded here and never opens one itself, so the rule there reads without
any of the plumbing.

It stays in this repository, with the `spikeinterface` pin in `envs/pyproject.toml`: it is not for
`dandi_cache_utils`, whose base image does not carry SpikeInterface. See `AGENTS.md`.
